"""Find a quote in the text it claims to come from.

An evidence item asserts something and offers quotes as the grounds. The only
way to know a quote is real is to look for it, so nothing here trusts a claim
about where text came from — it searches, and the search reports where the text
was found. That is stronger than asking a writer to name its source, because a
name can be wrong in a way a search cannot.

A paper read produces one job file holding several distinct bodies of text: the
narrative, each figure legend, and each supplementary prose document. They are
kept apart in the job file because they are different kinds of thing, and they
stay apart here, so a quote found in a caption is known to have come from a
caption rather than from the body.

Whitespace is normalised before matching and nothing else is. The sources are
re-wrapped from article XML and from Word, so line breaks differ from the
original while the words do not; anything looser would start accepting text the
author did not write.
