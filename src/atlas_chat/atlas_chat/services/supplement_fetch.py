"""Retrieve a paper's supplementary material into the supplement store.

The companion to :mod:`atlas_chat.services.supplement_store`, which owns disk
layout and the manifest. This module only gets bytes, and records how it got
them (or why it couldn't) in the manifest the store already defines.

The waterfall
-------------

The order below is not a guess; it comes from probing the 22 papers of the
reproductive-atlas corpus (Springer Nature, Cell Press, AAAS, JCI, Wiley,
Oxford, PNAS, and a bioRxiv preprint):

1. **Article XML** (``jats_listing``). Europe PMC's ``fullTextXML`` yields the
   filenames *and* the publisher's captions, which exist nowhere else and often
   describe the contents better than anything recoverable from the bytes.
   Available for 14 of 22.
2. **Europe PMC bundle** (``europepmc_bundle``). One zip per article, whose
   members are named exactly as the article XML lists them, so wanted files can
   be extracted and the figure images that bloat the zip skipped. Its virtue is
   that it needs no per-publisher knowledge at all. Streamed under a byte cap:
   observed 14–28 MB for most papers, but a 34-file PNAS paper exceeded 60 MB
   and the prenatal skin atlas exceeds 445 MB because of a supplementary video.
3. **Publisher-direct** (``publisher_direct``). Per-file, needing a URL template
   per publisher. Only Springer Nature is implemented, because its ESM stem is
   derivable from the DOI alone (verified on 8 of 8 Springer papers in the
   corpus) — for others, a template can be added when a corpus needs it.
4. **Manual** (``manual``). Recorded as a gap naming the file and where to get
   it. The only route for the 5 corpus papers with no PMC record at all, and for
   closed-access papers generally.

Two traps this module exists to avoid
-------------------------------------

*The bundle endpoint returns HTTP 200 with an empty body* for a PMC paper whose
full text is not open — 165 bytes, not a zip. Written naively that is an empty
archive recorded as a success, and the paper looks like it has no supplements.
It is detected and recorded as ``unavailable``.

*A missing supplement asked for on every run.* Every route that fails stamps
``retrieval.attempted_at``, and a later run skips it unless a retry is
requested. That is the negative cache.
