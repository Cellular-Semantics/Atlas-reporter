"""Make a paper's supplementary *prose* readable, and record what it contains.

`tables` covers everything with a header row, and `index-supplements` already
characterises those well — `outline` shows a sheet's title rows and block
headers, `slice` reads any region of it. Prose has none of that. A Supplementary
Discussion or a table-legends document has no columns to read, so `outline_file`
sees nothing in it and the manifest has nowhere to record it. Gopee's bundle
ships 15 KB of exactly that, and the legends are where Supplementary Table 22
announces itself as the DEG table for the four macrophage subsets.

So this module does for prose what the store already does for tables: extract
it, say how big it is, and give a reader enough to decide whether to open it.

How much it gives depends on size, because the decision differs:

* **Short enough to read** — the whole text. There is nothing to decide; the
  indexing agent reads it directly, and a cheap intermediary would only lose
  fidelity on the highest-leverage read in the bundle.
* **Too long to read on spec** — a characterisation instead. For a PDF that is
  its outline: pymupdf4llm tags every paragraph with the heading above it, so
  the section list says what the document is almost for free, and a Supplementary
  Methods announces itself without being read. Failing that, a sample of the
  head, middle and tail. Either goes to a cheap judge, which answers only
  whether it is worth folding in.

That question — does it name cell types — is what routes prose, because prose
that does is read *whole* alongside the paper text. Tables never are, however
relevant: Supplementary Table 5 in this bundle is 95 MB and 396,877 rows. The
format decides, not a score.

No model is called here. The judging is a subagent driven by the
``index-supplements`` skill: ``units`` hands out the evidence, ``record`` takes
the verdicts back.

PDFs need the ``text-access`` extra.
