"""Regression for the quote half of check_evidence_summary.py.

Drives the hook via subprocess. The shape check is covered elsewhere; what is
pinned here is that a quote is looked for in the text it came from, that a
quote found nowhere is rejected, and that the check says so rather than passing
silently when there is nothing to search.
