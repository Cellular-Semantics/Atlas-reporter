# Subagent: read the atlas paper

You are reading one paper to answer questions about several cell types. You will
be given each cell type in turn: what the atlas records about it, then the
questions.

**Every assertion you make must be backed by a quote copied verbatim from the
job file.** An answer without a quote is worthless here, however correct it may
be. If you cannot find text supporting a claim, do not make the claim — say the
paper does not address it.

Answer only from the job file at the path you were given. Your knowledge of
these cell types is not evidence: use it to recognise a synonym or expand an
abbreviation, never as the content of an answer.

Copy quotes character for character. **Never splice** — one continuous run of
text, no ellipsis bridging. Two passages means two quotes.

**Check each quote before you record it.** Search the job file for the text you
are about to quote. If the search does not find it, you have not copied it
exactly — fix it or drop it. A quote that cannot be found is rejected after the
fact anyway, so finding out now is cheaper.

## What you are given

**A project name and the cell types to read for.** That is all: which cell types
matter is a judgement someone else has made, and everything else follows from
the project.

## First, assemble your inputs

Three steps, all deterministic — no model is involved in any of them — so run
them and read what they report.

**Where things are.**

```bash
uv run python -m atlas_chat.cli_project paths --project <project>
```

This gives you the project directory, its CAS+ document, the atlas DOI, the
paper's text, the supplement store and the traversal output directory. It also
lists whatever it could not find: a missing paper or a missing store is
something to report, not to work around by searching the filesystem for
something that looks close enough.

**The paper.**

```bash
uv run --extra text-access --extra supplements python -m atlas_chat.cli_paper_ingest \
  --text <paper text> --doi <doi> --store <supplement store> \
  --out <traversal output>/papers/<paper>/paper.json
```

This assembles the paper's narrative, its figure legends, its cited sentences
and the supplementary prose already judged to bear on describing cell types.

`<paper>` is a short name for this paper — `atlas`, or the registry label of a
contributing study. **Everything from this read goes in that one directory**:
the paper itself and the evidence you write from it. That is where the quote
check looks for the text your quotes have to be found in.

`truncated: true` means you have a ranked slice rather than the paper, and every
gap it lists is something you will not be able to find however hard you look —
say so in your answers rather than recording a silence you cannot account for.

**The subjects.**

```bash
uv run python -m atlas_chat.cli_subject_block --cas <cas.json> \
  --label <cell label> [--label <cell label> …] \
  --out <traversal output>/subjects.json
```

A subject block is the atlas's own label, its full name, any synonyms it
records, its parent and children, and where and when its cells were sampled.

**It says who you are being asked about. It is not evidence.** The atlas's view
of a cell type is not a statement this paper made, and nothing in a subject
block may be quoted or reported as a finding. The children are there for one
reason: a subdivision of a cell type is not another name for it, and you cannot
apply that rule without knowing what the subdivisions are.

Then read both files. Do not paste either into anything.

## What the job file holds

- `narrative` — the paper's body prose, with section headings
- `legends` — figure and table captions, kept separate from the prose. A caption
  is not body prose, and naming information often appears in one and nowhere else
- `cited_sentences` — sentences carrying a citation, with the references they
  resolve to
- `supplement_prose` — supplementary documents judged to bear on describing cell
  types

`narrative` and each `supplement_prose` entry carry their text as `blocks` — the
paragraphs it is made of, one per line — so `offset` and `limit` page the file
normally. A whole paper is more than one read; take it in sections rather than
reaching for the whole file and getting a silently truncated view of it.

## The questions

Take the cell types **one at a time**, in the order given.

### Naming, first

Before anything else, work out every way this paper refers to this cell type.
The aim is recall: you will use this set of names to find the passages that
answer everything below, and a name you miss is a passage you miss.

Collect:

- the full name used in running prose, and any abbreviation or cluster
  identifier standing for it;
- any alternative name the paper uses for the same population;
- **the general cell type the paper says this is.** A paper makes statements of
  two kinds — some about this particular set of cells, some about the cell type
  it is asserted to be — and both bear on what follows.

Quote where each form appears. Say which forms are this atlas's own label for
this set of cells and which name the general cell type it is claimed to be: a
later answer may rest on one rather than the other, and a reader needs to know
which.

Also record — **without treating them as names for this subject** — any
population the paper describes that is a subdivision of it, a sibling of it, or
a broader class containing it. These are not this cell type. Knowing the paper's
word for them is what stops a statement about one being read as a statement
about the other.

**Use this set of names when answering every question below.**

### Then, for the same cell type

**Location.** Where is it found — organ, compartment, developmental stage?

**Markers.** Which genes does this paper name as characterising it?

**Structure.** Any description of its morphology. Do any of its marker genes
bear on that structure — is a gene said to produce, maintain or mark a
structural feature?

**Function.** What is it said to do? Do any of its marker genes bear on that
function — is a gene's product said to carry out or enable what the cell does?

For **every one of these**, say what the paper did to establish it: an imaging
or spatial method, a computed comparison, an inference from expression, or a
statement carried from earlier work — and if the sentence carries a citation, it
is the last of those.

**Quote both the claim and its basis.** They are frequently different sentences,
and the basis is often in a figure legend rather than the body.

Where the paper asserts something and gives no basis, say so. That is a finding
about the paper, not a gap in your reading.

Where the paper does not address something at all: `found: false`, no quotes,
and say so in `summary`. **This is a correct and expected outcome.** Declining
is not failing; guessing is.

## What you write

One file per cell type, beside the paper you read it from, at
`<traversal output>/papers/<paper>/<cell type>.evidence.json` — an array of
evidence items, one per aspect:

```json
[
  {
    "cell_label": "Immune_oLAM",
    "aspect": "location",
    "found": true,
    "summary": "…what the paper says, and what it did to establish it…",
    "quotes": ["…the claim, verbatim…", "…its basis, verbatim…"],
    "source_paper": {"doi": "…", "role": "atlas"},
    "retrieval_method": "whole_text"
  }
]
```

**`cell_label` is what the item is about, and the only way anything finds it
again.** It is the atlas's own label for the cell set, exactly as the subject
block gives it — never a name this paper uses, however much better that name
reads.

One cell type per item. You are answering about one cell type at a time, and an
answer that would bear on a second is a second answer: what a paper says about
one cell set is rarely quite what it says about another, and the difference is
usually the interesting part.

The filename is a convenience for anyone listing the directory. It is not the
identity: getting it wrong costs nothing, getting `cell_label` wrong loses the
item.

`summary` is yours to write. `quotes` is not: it is the paper's words, and every
assertion in `summary` must rest on one of them. An item with `found: true` and
no quotes will be rejected.

You are writing several files. Write each one as you finish that cell type
rather than holding them all to the end, so that a failure part way through
leaves finished work on disk rather than losing it.
